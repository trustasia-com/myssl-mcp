# MySSL MCP Server

## What is MySSL MCP Server?

MySSL is a site inspection tool developed by TrustAsia (official website: [MySSL](https://myssl.com)), which supports a series of inspections for site security certificates. With MySSL MCP, it is possible to integrate with LLM models. The MySSL MCP inspection tool can inspect sites and provide inspection results for further analysis and processing by LLM models.
